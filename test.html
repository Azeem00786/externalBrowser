            <p>you may want to use React Native CLI. It requires Xcode or Android Studio to get started. If you already have one of these tools installed, 
            you should be able to get up and running within a few minutes. If they are not installed, you should expect to spend about an hour installing and configuring them.</p>

            <h2>Blog Post Title 2</h2>
            <p>A compelling reason for using React Native instead of WebView-based tools is to achieve 60 frames per second and a native look 
                and feel to your apps. Where possible, we would like for React Native to do the right thing and help you to focus on your app instead of 
                performance optimization, but there are areas where we're not quite there yet, and others where React Native (similar to writing native code directly) cannot possibly
                determine the best way to optimize for you and so manual intervention will be necessary. We try our best
                to deliver buttery-smooth UI performance by default, but sometimes that isn't possible.</p>

            <p>Desktop and VR have historically relied on mouse and keyboard input where mobile is primarily touch. That narrative has evolved with touch-screen laptops and growing needs to 
            support interactions via keyboard and pen on mobile. All of which the React Native touch event system is not equipped to handle.</p>
